# The dark side of Open Source Software


Although we find open source software to be valuable and, in fact, essential to
the progress of open and reproducible science, there is a dark side to open
source software. As your open source project becomes increasingly popular and
people outside of your group begin to use it more and more—which is great and
is the goal—there will necessarily be additional maintenance. Bugs will be
found, issues opened, new features requested, questions asked. The source of
some of these issues may not even be you or your software. After the scientific
question has been answered, and the primary funding has come to an end, who is
to maintain the software? 


Ways to fight the dark side and mitigate the downsides. Well written code, good
practices will help new developers pick up the code and maintain it. New
funding to answer new questions should include development and maintenance in
the budget. What about other software projects that depend on yours?
