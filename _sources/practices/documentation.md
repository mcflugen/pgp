# Documentation

A successful open source project will provide users and developers with
documentation that describes how someone can use the software, either as a user
or as a developer. Documentation need not be extensive and, if fact, a concise
README file is often enough. From the perspective of an end-user who may only
be in the evaluation stage, poor (or no) documentation will quickly cause them
frustration and  they will move on to something new. For users intent on using
your software, even a minimal amount of documentation can make a significant
difference in the speed with which they learn the ins-and-outs of your software
and get to discovering new science. For users wanting to extend, contribute, or
use your software, the same applies—even minimal documentation can make a world
of difference.


A README file is often the first point of contact for a new or potential user
of your software. To be helpful, your README file should contain information
necessary for a user to discover what your software does and how to get
started. Below we list some possible sections for a good README:
* Summary: briefly describe what your software does. This shouldn’t be more than
  a short paragraph that gives a user an overview but shouldn’t go into much
  detail. You can include links to more detailed documentation or papers for the
  interested user.
* Requirements: A list of software a new user will need to install to user your
  software.
* Installation: Step-by-step instructions that show a user how to install your
  software—either as a user (e.g. as a pre-compiled package, possibly from a
  package manager) or as a developer (i.e. from source).
* Quick start: You should include a section that describes how a new user can get
  up-and-running with your software quickly by providing a simple working
  example. The example should be overly complicated and should run quickly. This
  gives a user the knowledge that not only does your software work but also how
  they might use it.
* Description of input files: If your software requires any input files, you
  should describe the format of these files and provide an example or two that
  the user can use as templates. A user will often find it more useful to have a
  set of template input files that they can alter to fit their need rather than
  referring to a description. Both you and your users will use relieved if your
  software uses standard file formats. You because there will likely already be
  existing software to read and write the files of this format and also you can
  point users to external documentation for the formats. Users because they will
  be more likely to already be familiar and comfortable with the format.
* Description of output files: You should also provide a description of the
  output your software will produce as well as the file formats. Again—for the
  same reasons as with input files—both you and your users will be happy if you
  stick with standard file formats.

A user wanting to contribute to your software will find it easier to contribute
documentation rather than code. The documentation will be their first contact
with your software and so they will be able to relate to it and have an idea of
what works, what doesn’t and where there are errors or where instructions could
be clarified. If contributing code, they may be worried that they will break
something, but suggesting documentation changes will seem less risky. Once they
get the hang of contributing, they will be more likely to make additional
contributions, and become full-time user-developers.
